Section 1: Lauren's Bio
	I am a Computer Sciecne student at Michigan State University. I really love what I study and don't only enjoy in the class room, but outside of it as well! When I'm not in the MSU Engineering Building writing programs, I may be at a hackathon or in my room reading books about algorithms. Other activities I enjoy participating in are swimming, boating, and snowboarding. Spending time with my friends and family is important to me, therefore when I have the opportunity to participate in activities I enjoy with people I love I am very happy.
