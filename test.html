                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>I'm Lauren Malik! Currently I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science from Michigan State University's College of Engineering. When I'm not coding or attending classes, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. Growing up in Southeast Michigan near Lake St. Clair naturally lead me to develop a love for water sports such as swimming, wakeboarding, and boating. I really enjoy listening to a myriad of music genres and playing the piano. My love for Computer Science is much more than just an academic persual; Attending hackathons, completing coding challenges, and working on personal projects is not just another hobby of mine, but a lifestyle. Through the power of programming it is possible for me to incorporate my creative and analytic skills to develop amazing applications. Enjoy your visit to www.lauren_malik.com!</p>
